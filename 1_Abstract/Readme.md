## Simulation  OF Password Based Door Locking System  
A digital door lock system is equipment that uses the
digital information such as a secret code, semi-conductors, smart card,
and finger prints as the method for authentication instead of the legacy
key system. In our proposed system, a ZigBee module is embedded in
digital door lock and the door lock acts as a central main controller of
the overall home automation system. Technically, our proposed system
is the network of sensor nodes and actuators with digital door lock as
base station. A door lock system proposed here consists of RFID reader
for user authentication, touch LCD, motor module for opening and
closing of the door, sensor modules for detecting the condition inside
the house, communication module, and control module for controlling
other modules. Sensor nodes for environment sensing are deployed at
appropriate places at home. Status of individual ZigBee module can be
monitored and controlled by the centralized controller, digital door
lock. As the door lock is the first and last thing people come across in
entering and leaving the home respectively, the home automation
function in digital door lock system enables user to conveniently control
and monitor home environment and condition all at once before
entering or leaving the house. Furthermore, it also allows users to
remotely monitor the condition inside the house through Internet or
any other public network. The biggest advantage of our proposed
system over existing ones is that it can be easily installed when and
where necessary without requirement of any infrastructures and
proper planning.
